# Pendulum Simulation

In this experiment, a pendulum's rotating settling time was measured. In the following code, I then modeled and simulated this using different iterative schemes, and compared to the experimental results. Matlab's ode45 function was compared to Euler's method and shows the increased accuracy of higher-order schemes. I also compared the simulated results for different models, such as assuming the pendulum is a rigid body or point-mass, and assuiming the rotation angle is small to linearize the ODE.
