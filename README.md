# Pendulum Simulation

In this project, a pendulum's rotating settling time was measured. I then modeled and simulated this using different iterative schemes, and compared to them to experimental results. Matlab's ode45 function was compared to Euler's method and shows the increased accuracy of higher-order schemes. I also compared the simulated results for different models, such as assuming the pendulum is a rigid body or point-mass, and assuming the rotation angle is small to linearize the ODE.
